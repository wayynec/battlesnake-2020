Goal: 
1) Don't go beyond the wall
2) Don't collide its own body
3) Don't collide with other snake body(except head)
4) Eat food to survive
------------------------------------------------------

Implementation idea
1)Create adjacency matrix of n row by n colmun. and always update this in move function.
=> By doing this we can see the available space

=>entry of matrix is:
	Available space->0
	Body of snake->1
	Food->2

2)Find a shortest path to food by BFS.
